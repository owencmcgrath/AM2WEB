# Apple Music Stats Analyzer

A Flask web application that transforms your Apple Music library export into beautiful, detailed analytics about your listening habits and music preferences.

## Why This Was Built

Ever wondered what your music listening habits really look like? Apple Music provides basic year-end summaries, but what about the deeper insights hiding in your library data? This project was born from curiosity about personal music analytics - discovering patterns in listening behavior, identifying songs that have grown on you over time, and visualizing how your musical taste has evolved across decades.

The goal was to create a comprehensive tool that goes beyond simple play counts, offering insights like skip ratios, listening patterns by time of day, album completion rates, and artist consistency metrics that Apple Music doesn't provide.

## How This Was Built

This application processes Apple Music's XML library exports to extract detailed listening data and presents it through an intuitive web interface. The development approach focused on:

- **Data Processing**: Custom XML parser to handle Apple Music's complex export format
- **Analytics Engine**: SQL queries designed to uncover meaningful patterns in listening behavior
- **User Experience**: Clean, responsive interface that makes complex data accessible
- **Privacy-First**: User authentication system ensuring personal music data stays private

The entire stack was chosen for simplicity and reliability - Flask for rapid development, MySQL for robust data handling, and vanilla CSS/JavaScript for a lightweight frontend.
